    "In this chapter, we continue our analysis of digital links.  The LDPC codes are widely used in applications. Moreover, they are a great illustration of Bayes' Rule.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1 LDPC Code\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The LDPC code works as follows.  One transmits an  $n$-bit string $\\mathbf{x}$ that we represent as a column vector.  To protect the transmission against errors, one appends an $m$-bit string $\\mathbf{y}$ that one computes as $\\mathbf{y} = H\\mathbf{x}$ where $H$ is an $m$-by-$n$ matrix whose entries are $0$ and $1$ and the operations are modulo $2$.  Typically, most entries of $H$ are zeros, hence the name **low density parity codes**.  The discussion below is similar to that in the book.  We include it here to be self-contained.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain the algorithm, consider the example illustrated in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](Figs/ldpc.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, $y_1 = x_1 + x_3 + x_4$.  Also, $\\mathbf{x} = 0100101$ and $\\mathbf{y} = 001$.\n",
    "The transmitter sends $[\\mathbf{x} | \\mathbf{y}] = 0100101001$. There is one transmission error and the receiver gets $[\\mathbf{x}' | \\mathbf{y}'] = 0100101000$.  Since $\\mathbf{y}' \\neq H \\mathbf{x}'$, the receiver knows that there was at least one transmission error.  How can it locate the errors?  Assuming that errors are unlikely, the receiver should find the minimum number of bits to flip in $[\\mathbf{x}' | \\mathbf{y}']$ to satisfy the equations.  By looking exhaustively, the receiver can find that the equations are satisfied by flipping only the last bit.  This takes $n + m$ checks.  However, if more than one bit has been flipped, this exhaustive exploration is too time-consuming to be feasible when $m$ and $n$ are large.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of an exhaustive exploration, the algorithm proceeds iteratively as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step** $1$: The $x$-nodes $\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}$ on the left in the graph of the figure compute their estimates $p_j$ of $P(x_j = 1)$.\n",
    "For instance, since $x_1^\\prime = 0$ and the probability that an error flips the bit is $\\epsilon$, node $x_1$\n",

    "\n",

Node $y_1$ has received the estimates $p_1, p_3, p_4$ from the $x$-nodes and it knows that $y_1 = x_1 + x_3 + x_4$ and $y_1^\\prime = 1$.  Thus,\n",
    "$x_1 = 1$ if $y_1 = 1 + x_3 + x_4$, i.e., if an odd number of random variables among $\\{y_1, x_3, x_4\\}$\n",
    "are equal to one. Let us call that event $E$. You can verify that $z = [1 - (1 - 2y_1)(1 - 2x_3)(1 - 2x_4)]/2$ is \n",
    "equal to one if $E$ occurs and to zero otherwise.  Hence, assuming independence,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(E) = E(z) = [1 - (1 - 2P(y_1 = 1)(1 - 2P(x_3=1))(1 - 2P(x_4=1))]/2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that $y_1^\\prime = 0$, we find as before, using Bayes' Rule, that $P[y_1 = 1|y_1^\\prime = 0] = \\epsilon$.\n",
    "Also, $P(x_j = 1)= p_j$.  Hence, we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q_1(1) = P(x_1 = 1) = P(E) = E(z) = [1 - (1 - 2 \\epsilon)(1 - 2p_3)(1 - 2p_4)]/2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The other $y$-nodes update their estimates in the same way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step** $2$: The $y$-nodes send their estimates to the $x$-nodes to which they are connected.  Consider node $x_1$. It gets the estimates $q_1(1), q_2(1)$ from nodes $y_1$ and $y_2$.  Also, it remembers that $x_1^\\prime = 0$.  Node $x_1$ uses these observations to update $p_1$ as follows:\n",
